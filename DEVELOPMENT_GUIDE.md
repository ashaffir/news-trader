# Development Setup Guide

## ✅ Fixed Development Environment

This guide documents the **completely fixed** local development setup that solves all previous issues with restarts, hot reloading, and WebSocket instability.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start all services
./dev_manager.sh start

# Check status  
./dev_manager.sh status

# View logs
./dev_manager.sh logs

# Restart everything
./dev_manager.sh restart

# Interactive mode (NEW!)
./dev_manager.sh
```

## 🌟 What's New & Fixed

### ✅ **WebSocket Issues SOLVED!**
- **Completely removed WebSockets** - they were causing constant disconnections
- **Replaced with simple polling** - updates every 3 seconds via API
- **Much more reliable** - no more "WebSocket Disconnected" errors
- **Simpler infrastructure** - no channels, daphne, or Redis channel layers needed

### ✅ **Hot Reloading Fixed**
- Django development server with automatic code reloading
- Celery worker restarts when code changes
- No more manual service restarts needed

### ✅ **Clean Service Management**
- Automatic process cleanup
- No more duplicate processes
- Clean starts every time

## 🔧 Architecture Changes

### Key Settings Changed
- Uses Django development server with hot reloading
- PostgreSQL database with local connection  
- **Simple polling for updates** (replaced WebSockets!)
- Better logging configuration
- More stable and reliable real-time updates

## Commands Reference

### Service Management
```bash
./dev_manager.sh start      # Start all services
./dev_manager.sh stop       # Stop all services  
./dev_manager.sh restart    # Restart all services
./dev_manager.sh status     # Show service status
./dev_manager.sh cleanup    # Kill any stuck processes
./dev_manager.sh reload     # Restart Celery worker only
```

### Logs
```bash
./dev_manager.sh logs                    # View all logs
./dev_manager.sh logs django            # Django logs only
./dev_manager.sh logs celery_worker     # Celery worker logs
./dev_manager.sh logs celery_beat       # Celery beat logs
```

### Interactive Mode (NEW!)
```bash
./dev_manager.sh            # Launch interactive menu
```

## 🌐 Access Points

After running `./dev_manager.sh start`:

- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8000/
- **Test Page**: http://localhost:8000/test-page/ 
- **Admin**: http://localhost:8000/admin/

## No More Issues! 🎉
- ✅ **Code changes automatically reload**
- ✅ **Services start cleanly every time** 
- ✅ **No more duplicate processes**
- ✅ **No more WebSocket disconnections**
- ✅ **Stable real-time updates via polling**
- ✅ **Much simpler and more reliable**

## 🔄 Real-Time Updates

The system now uses **simple polling** instead of WebSockets:

- **Updates every 3 seconds** - perfect for trading activity
- **Much more reliable** - works everywhere, no connection issues
- **Automatic fallback** - graceful error handling
- **No infrastructure complexity** - just database + AJAX

## Troubleshooting

### If services won't start:
```bash
./dev_manager.sh cleanup
./dev_manager.sh start
```

### If you see old WebSocket errors:
- **This should be completely fixed now!** 
- All WebSocket code has been removed
- If you still see them, refresh your browser cache

### Check service status:
```bash
./dev_manager.sh status
```

### View logs:
```bash
./dev_manager.sh logs
```

## 🎯 Perfect for Development

This setup is now **production-ready** for local development:
- Fast iteration cycles
- Reliable real-time updates  
- Clean service management
- No more frustrating restarts or disconnections

**Your development experience is now smooth and professional!** 🚀
