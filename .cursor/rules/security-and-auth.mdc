### Django views
- Most UI and internal API endpoints are decorated with `@staff_member_required`
- Keep administrative pages and actions staff-only (dashboard, triggers, trade mgmt)

### DRF defaults
- `REST_FRAMEWORK` enforces `IsAuthenticated` by default: see [`news_trader/settings.py`](mdc:news_trader/settings.py)
- Tests add token authentication classes in [`news_trader/test_settings.py`](mdc:news_trader/test_settings.py)

### Public endpoints
- `public_posts_api` is currently staff-protected; adjust decorator intentionally if exposing publicly

### Best practices for new code
- Protect any trading, scraping, or analysis triggers behind staff-only or authenticated APIs
- Avoid leaking secrets in responses or logs
